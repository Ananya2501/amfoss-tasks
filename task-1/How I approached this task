Repository for amfoss tasks
I read the instructions in the given link. I did as it was told. I had issues accessing the code. But by interacting with my mentors in my group #charizard.
After successfully pasting my code in the browser console, I had issues with running the code.
The problem was that I did not open the browser console in the github tab while running the code. But when I did it. I got the required result.
